# IMEI Generator
Identical to [IMEI Generator (tkinter)](https://github.com/SakuraSakuraro/imeigen/). I just replaced tkinter to pyqt5

This IMEI generator is intended primarily for entertainment purposes and for generating IMEIs for virtual machines for purposes of development or/and testing, but it also has uses in educational purposes. I am not responsible for any illegal use of the program (for example: generating IMEIs for stolen phones as purposes to replacing legitimate IMEIs). Users are solely responsible for their actions and use of this program. I strongly condemn any use of this program for purposes that violate Japanese laws or any countries. 

I'm sincerely hope that you understand this and will not use the program for any illegal activities, ありがとうございます！
